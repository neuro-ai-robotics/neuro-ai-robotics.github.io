<h2>Neuroscience-inspired AI for personalized control of wearable robots</h2>
<a href="https://momentum.csic.es/en/" target="_blank">MOMENTUM PROGRAM CSIC</a>

<p>Mobility problems are the common denominator of many diseases, neurological causes, and
musculoskeletal conditions that affect hundreds of thousands of citizens each year. Being able
to assist the mobility of these people is central to society and the healthcare system. The main
goal of this project is the development of a new generation of intelligent and customizable
Wearable Robots (WRs) to assist users with mobility problems in their day-to-day lives. To
achieve this, a neuro-inspired Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be developed for the perception and
control of WRs, based on deep reinforcement learning. It will be trained on different mobility
pathologies and users modeled with musculoskeletal digital twins. These algorithms will be
implemented in sensorized exoskeletons, adapted for safe use in real environments. The selected
candidate will join a young, highly active, interdisciplinary research group in the fields of AI,
robotics, and neuroscience.</p>
